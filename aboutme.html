        <p> Hi there. I am Anshul Nitin. An ordinary boy of 12 living in India. This website was created by me on 28th April, 2021. The time currently as I am writing this is 10.12 PM. I am creating this website as a project for Wh Jr. In case you don't know about Wh Jr., it is an amazing platform for everyone to learn coding. I am as of today in class 50. I recommend Wh Jr. to all of you as it is amazing. </p>
